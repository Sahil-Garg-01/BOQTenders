# BOQTenders Prompt Templates
# YAML format for better production management and versioning

qa_template: |
  You are an expert assistant specializing in construction and tender documents, with deep knowledge of Bill of Quantities (BOQ) analysis. Your role is to provide accurate, helpful, and professional responses based solely on the provided context.

  Guidelines:
  - Always base your answers on the given context. Do not use external knowledge or assumptions.
  - For BOQ-related questions, provide detailed, structured information including item codes, descriptions, quantities, units, rates, and amounts where available.
  - If the context lacks specific information, respond with: "The requested information is not available in the provided document context."
  - Be concise yet comprehensive. Structure responses clearly (e.g., use bullet points or tables for lists).
  - Handle follow-up questions by referencing previous context in the conversation history.
  - Maintain neutrality and professionalism in all responses.

  {context}

  Question: {question}
  Answer:

metadata_extraction_template: |
  Extract key information from this tender document excerpt in a concise format:
  - Document Type
  - Project Name
  - Issuing Authority
  - Tender Number
  - Date
  - Location

  Document excerpt:
  {document_text}

  Output only the facts, no extra analysis.

boq_extraction_template: |
  Analyze this text and extract ONLY Bill of Quantities (BOQ) line items if present.

  Look for structured data with:
  - Item numbers or codes
  - Item names (short, concise names for the items, e.g., "Cable Supply", "Light Installation")
  - Descriptions of work/materials (extract the complete, full description as it appears in the document, without truncation)
  - Quantities
  - Units (Nos, Sqm, Cum, m, etc.)
  - Rates/Unit prices
  - Total amounts

  If you find BOQ items, return them in this EXACT format (pipe-separated):
  ITEM_CODE|ITEM_NAME|DESCRIPTION|QUANTITY|UNIT|RATE|AMOUNT|CONFIDENCE

  Where:
  - ITEM_NAME is a very short, direct name for the item (2-6 words max), focusing on the core item type and key specifications. Create it dynamically based on the description:
    - Identify the main item (e.g., cable, conduit, light, switch, breaker, electrode)
    - Include essential specs in parentheses (e.g., size, wattage, voltage)
    - Remove redundant words like "supplying and fixing", "installation of"
    - Examples: "Cable (185 sq.mm)", "LED Downlight (36W)", "PVC Conduit (20mm)", "MCB (63A)", "Earth Electrode"
  - DESCRIPTION is the complete, full description as it appears in the document
  - CONFIDENCE is a score (0-100%) based on how clearly and completely the data appears in the text. Use lower scores (e.g., 70-90%) if information is partially missing, inferred, or unclear. Use 100% only for complete, directly stated data.

  Rules for columns:
  - If an entire column has no values, omit that column.
  - For missing values, use "NA".

  Return multiple items on separate lines. If NO BOQ items are found, return: "NO_BOQ_ITEMS"

  Text to analyze:
  {batch_text}

  Extract only actual BOQ line items.

boq_improvement_template: |
  You are reviewing a previous BOQ extraction to find MISSED items and improve incomplete data.
  
  **Previous BOQ Extraction (already found):**
  {previous_boq}
  
  **Raw Text to analyze for MISSED items:**
  {batch_text}
  
  **Your task:**
  1. Look for BOQ items in the raw text that are NOT in the previous extraction
  2. For items already extracted, check if quantities/units show "NA" but actual values exist in text
  3. DO NOT duplicate items that are already correctly extracted
  4. RESPECT any extraction constraints specified above - only extract items within the specified scope
  
  **When to extract:**
  ✓ Found a NEW item (different item code/description) not in previous BOQ AND within allowed scope
  ✓ Found an item where previous shows "NA" but text has actual quantity/unit/rate
  
  **When to skip (return NO_BOQ_ITEMS):**
  ✗ Item is already in previous BOQ with complete data
  ✗ This batch has no BOQ content
  ✗ Items mentioned are already correctly extracted
  ✗ Item is outside the specified extraction scope/constraint
  
  **Return format (pipe-separated):**
  ITEM_CODE|ITEM_NAME|DESCRIPTION|QUANTITY|UNIT|RATE|AMOUNT|CONFIDENCE
  
  **Examples:**
  - Previous has Item 1-46, you find Item 47 → Extract Item 47
  - Previous has Item 10 with Quantity=NA, text shows Quantity=100 → Extract corrected Item 10
  - Previous has Item 5 complete, text mentions it again → Return NO_BOQ_ITEMS
  
  Focus on finding GENUINELY MISSED items.
